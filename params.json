Alternatively, you can set the input node values manually.\r\n\t\t\t\ttargetData: [[1], [1], [0], [0]], //The expected values for the output nodes. Will be used to train the network\r\n\t\t\t\tlearningRate: 0.5 //The rate at which the propagation occurs. Higher values = faster learning, but also make the learning more inaccurate.\r\n\t\t\t});;\r\n```\r\nNow, you want to train your network. Lets backpropagate this network 500 times:\r\n```js\r\nfor (var i = 0; i < 500; i++) {\r\n    network.backpropagate();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nGreat, now your network is trained! To test it, lets set the input nodes to a certain test case:\r\n```js\r\nnetwork.setInputs([1, 0]);\r\nnetwork.calculate(); //Calculate the values for each node\r\nconsole.log(network.getNode(\"OUTPUT\", 0)); //Should print something close to \"1\" (depending on how well the network trained, this value should vary from 1 by a very small amount)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example 2: Neuroevolution\r\nBackpropagation is all fun and good, but sometimes there are cases where you prefer to evolve a network instead (such as when you don't know what the topography of the network will end up like). This is where neuroevolution comes in! Neuroevolution in Cerebrum is based on the N.E.A.T. algorithm, so features such as speciation and innovation are built in!\r\n\r\nFirst off, reference the library:\r\n```html\r\n<script src=\"cerebrum.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\nThen, create a variable in javascript such as the one below:\r\n```js\r\nneuroevolution = new Neuroevolution({\t\t\t\t\r\n\tinputNodes: 2,\r\n\toutputNodes: 1,\r\n\thiddenNodeCap: 3, //The max amount of hidden nodes that can be created\r\n\tpopulationSize: 100 //The number of genomes create and evolve in each generation\r\n});\r\n```\r\nNeuroevolution works by creating a population of genomes that represent networks. These genomes evolve, mutate, and breed in order to create networks with new innovations. But in order to determine which genomes should breed and which should die in each generation, each genome's \"fitness\" needs to be determined so that they can be compared against other genomes. That's where the fitness function comes in:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar inputData = [[1, 0], [0, 1], [0, 0], [1, 1]];\r\nvar targetData = [[1], [1], [0], [0]];\r\n\r\nneuroevolution.fitnessFunction = function (network) { //This function is used by Cerebrum to determine the fitness of each genome. Alternatively, the fitness can be set manually for each genome before the population evolves.\r\n\tvar fitness = 0;\r\n\tfor (var j = 0; j < inputData.length; j++) {\r\n\t\tnetwork.setInputs(inputData[j]);\r\n\t\tnetwork.calculate();\r\n\t\tfitness += 1 - Math.pow(Math.abs(network.getNode(\"OUTPUT\", 0).value - targetData[j][0]),  2); //This equation will set the fitness for each genome by comparing how close the genome's network's output is to the target data, when the genome's network is fed the input data. The squaring function is used to disproportionally punish genomes that produce outputs that extremely vary from the target data.\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn fitness / inputData.length;\r\n};\r\nneuroevolution.createInitialPopulation(); //Create the initial, random population of genomes\r\n```\r\nGreat, now let's evolve our population about 750 times!\r\n```js\r\nfor (var i = 0; i < 750; i++) {\r\n\tneuroevolution.calculateFitnesses();\r\n\tneuroevolution.evolve();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow that we have evolved the population of genomes, let's see the results by creating a test case!\r\n```js\r\nvar network = neuroevolution.getElite().getNetwork(); //Get the best genome from the population, and get the network it represents\r\nnetwork.setInputs(inputData[0]); //Feed the network the first test case's values\r\nnetwork.calculate(); //Calculate the values for each node\r\nconsole.log(network.getNode(\"OUTPUT\", 0)); //Should print something close to \"1\" (depending on how well the network trained, this value should vary from 1 by a very small amount)\r\n```\r\n",
